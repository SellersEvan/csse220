Reflection Questions:

1.A In your implementation could you replace Questions with Strings (yes or no)? 
No

1.B Why or why not? (2-3 sentences)
Because we want to encapsolate. This would also allow us to lose the ability to
add additional attributes to it in the future like answer. Or my was setup also allowed
you to see what question is in which quizes. That wouldn't be possible. The setup to use
a string instead of an object would be a poor choice for upgratibility and API access.


2.A. What data type did you use to represent the 1 to many relationship between QuizMain and Question? (provide type)
A hashmap was used to create this relasionship. Where you selected the numbers. If I was
designing this for a real system would obvisouly used generated uID's but also a database 
would normally take care of this.


2.B. What is another type could you have used? (provide type) 
Could of also used an array. How ever had concerns about upgradiability to allow
generated uID's. 

Another way which is the better way is to have uID's that are auto generated, using
a hashmap.


2.C. Would that have made the code better or worse? Why? (2-3 sentences)
Using an array would of not been better because it is slower to search an array, and is
less similar to a standard database structure. Also If the array were to be sorted or drop
a value your whole system is wrong.

The uID's would of been better with hashmap. It is more robusts. Less liklyhood of errors andmore similar to
standard structure of a database. This method is also quicker than an array.


Things to make it better
extra overloaded method so you could do something like...
addQuestion( id, new Question( "What is Programming?" ) );
The overloaded methods would just make it easier to add questions, quickly to a specific quiz.
